<h1 align='center'> Charles Kettell </h1>

I'm Charlie, an ambitious Full Stack Junior Software Developer who finds satisfaction in writing clean, elegant code and uncovering bugs. 

My path to the world of technology makes sense to me. At the University of Manchester, I studied history and by writing about topics such as Soviet society and the Iranian Revolution developed my self-led learning style. Whilst studying, my interest in Turkish Disco developed into an event-planning team and here I started to really enjoy the process of building "stuff". Since, I've worked for an international development organisation and a digital media agency, giving me further experience in making change happen and seeing the potential of software.

I would like to work for a company where I can continue developing my software skills, take on new knowledge and be involved in building something special. 

Tech Skills : Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, React, React Native, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL

## Skills

### Quick Learner

When working for Street Child of Nepal, I wrote a report assessing the impact of a £4m school-building project in partnership with UNICEF. This required me to quickly understand the background and implications of the project to formulate into a clear report. I have been able to apply this skill when taking on new technologies and learning new practices. 

### Self-Starter

When at university, I co-founded an even-planning team and focused on the growth of the night. To do so, I used channels such as Facebook to reach students throughout the city. As the team matured, I was able move into project management; this made me responsible for the negotiation with venues and artists as well as logistical problems during the events.

## Hobbies

I enjoy running, cycling and have recently developed a liking for bouldering. I have completed half and full Marathons, using the opportunities to raise over £4k for charities.

From comedy to the paradoxes of Soviet socialism, I like to read about an array of topics. Most recently, I've been learning about the safety of AI via the work of Nick Bostrom and Max Tegmark.

I have written in the past for marketing publications, my past companies and Makers Academy. I find this is a great way to uncover gaps in my knowledge on the task at hand. You can find all these on my Medium blog.
